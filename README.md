# DevConnector-Static

Main file is `landing.html`. From there you can check all the files.

`dashboard.html` is also available which must be opened after user login. So it can be checked through by using '/dashboard.html' in URL.

I have used `HTML`, `CSS` and `Bootstrap` for creating static front-end files.
